\title{Simulation of an Assembly process from a Meta-web assuming the interactions are conserved in the local web}
\usage{
metaWebNetAssemblyCT(metaW, m, e, se, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{metaW}{metacommunity adyacency matrix}

\item{m}{A numeric vector of species' migration rates (probability) from the meta-web}

\item{e}{A numeric vector of species' extinction probability}

\item{se}{A numeric vector of species' secondary extinction probability}

\item{time}{Number of time steps of simulation}
}
\value{
A list with the final the number of species by time S, the number of links by time L, 
              the time series of species STime and the adjacency matrix A with effective links.
}
\description{
This is a dynamical model of colonization and extinction process [1], similar to the TTIB model described in [2]. 
With an additional secondary extinctions probability that controls when a predator goes extinct if it has
no prey. This is a continuous time version of the model that follows the Gillespie algorithm [3] for simulation
There are 3 possible events migration with rate *m*, local extinction with rate *e*, and secondary extinction when
a predators has no prey with rate *se*. The parameters are vectors so each species could have their own parameter values.
